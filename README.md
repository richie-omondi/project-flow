As a busy working professional and student, I at times tend to get overwhelmed with all the work/study projects and commitments I have leading to frustration, missed deadlines, burnout and emotional distress. This negatively affects my ability to work and learn effectively which deteriorates my overall mental and emotional health, hindering me from being and performing at my best.

As a result, I decided to come up with an intuitive tool that I believe could help me effectively keep track of all my work/study commitments with value-adding features as listed below.

This is the first verison of the tool and I encourage any and all contributions that can make the tool more valuable and effective for students and professionals.

# Flow

Flow is a comprehensive project tracking application designed with a modern, professional interface. It offers a full suite of features to help teams and individuals manage projects efficiently from start to finish.

## Technologies Used

The web app was built using Lovable + Supabase


## Prompt Engineering

**This is the prompt I used to build the app on Lovable:**

Build a tool/web app to track projects, including work and study commitments, with features for adding and editing notes, file uploads, progress updates, and notifications.
Features
User authentication: Allow users to securely sign up and sign in.
Project Management: Allow users to upload and manage all work and study commitments.
Notes and File Uploads: Enable users to add notes and upload files/documents related to each project.
Progress Updates: Send users email updates about their progress on each project.
Notifications: Provide notifications for impending deadlines based on user-set priorities via email.
Steps
Define Requirements:


List all functionalities needed, such as user authentication, project creation, note-taking, file uploads, and notification settings.
Determine the technology stack (e.g., front-end, back-end, database, email service).
Design User Interface:


Create wireframes for the user interface, focusing on ease of use for project management, note-taking, and file uploads.
Design notification and email templates for progress updates and deadline alerts.
Develop Backend:


Set up a database to store user data, projects, notes, and files.
Implement server-side logic for handling project management, file uploads, and email notifications.
Develop Frontend:


Build the user interface based on the wireframes.
Ensure responsive design for accessibility on various devices.
Integrate Features:


Implement file upload functionality with appropriate storage solutions.
Set up email service for sending progress updates and notifications.
Develop a priority-based notification system for upcoming deadlines.
Testing:


Conduct thorough testing of all features, including user authentication, project management, file uploads, and notifications.
Perform user acceptance testing to ensure the app meets user needs.
Deployment:


Deploy the app on a suitable hosting platform.
Set up a domain and ensure the app is accessible to users.
Maintenance and Updates:


Monitor the app for any issues and provide regular updates to improve functionality and security.
Output Format
Provide a detailed project plan document, including timelines, resource allocation, and a roadmap for feature implementation.
Examples
Project Management:


Input: "Add new project 'Thesis Research' with deadline 2023-12-01."
Output: Project added with options to add notes and upload files.
Notifications:


Input: "Set priority for 'Thesis Research' to high."
Output: Notification scheduled for weekly progress updates and deadline reminders.
Notes
Consider user privacy and data security, especially for file uploads and email notifications.
Ensure the app is scalable to handle multiple users and large amounts of data.
Provide user support and documentation for app usage.
