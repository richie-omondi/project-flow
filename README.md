As a busy working professional and student, I at times tend to get overwhelmed with all the work/study projects and commitments I have leading to frustration, missed deadlines, burnout and emotional distress. This negatively affects my ability to work and learn effectively which deteriorates my overall mental and emotional health, hindering me from being and performing at my best.

As a result, I decided to come up with an intuitive tool that I believe could help me effectively keep track of all my work/study commitments with value-adding features as listed below.

This is the first verison of the tool and I encourage any and all contributions that can make the tool more valuable and effective for students and professionals.
